					Food and Globalization
	
In this episode of TEDx Talks, the show featured Sharwin Tee. Tee, a renowned chef, TV host, columnist, and author,
shares his culinary expertise through various platforms such as "Let's Do Lunch" and "Curiosity Got the Chef.”
His global recognition stems from collaborations with top companies, restaurants, and his own ventures worldwide,
promising audiences a fulfilling journey through food and culture. In the presentation, Sharwin Tee challenges the 
idea of a singular Filipino cuisine, highlighting instead the diverse ways Filipino home cooking is prepared and shared, 
showcasing the adaptability and hospitality of Filipinos despite regional differences.

The main argument of the speaker is that there is no "one standard authentic recipe" of any Filipino dish. He shared his 
experience during his time at DLSU Ozamiz, where Tee together with the locals, utilized seasonal and local ingredients at 
the peak of their freshness. This shows that the ingredients for Filipino dishes can be subjective depending on what suits 
people the most. Furthermore, he also discussed the “sawsawan culture”, which allows the dishes to be customizable for 
guests to feel welcome at our table. And that was the main point presented by the speaker highlighting that there is no 
one authentic recipe and the Filipino food simply showcases the best of the Filipino people.

I couldn't agree more to what Mr. Tee said. Oftentimes, there are a lot of arguments online regarding foreigners receiving 
negative feedback because of the way they cook Filipino foods, or even Filipinos being criticized by Filipinos as well. I 
find it ridiculous just how people are enraged by such a simple matter. I understand that some dishes need to be cooked in
a specific way. But you cannot blame other people, especially those foreign from your country, if they cook their version 
of a certain dish to their convenience. I think the points discussed by the speaker greatly depict two of our most known 
identities, Filipino hospitality and adaptability. The use of seasonal ingredients and those that are at the peak of their
freshness shows just that. It means that we Filipinos can easily adapt to our surroundings and still be great just like our 
dishes. The “sawsawan culture” on the other hand, shows how welcoming we are to our beloved guests. This culture does not 
mean that we're not confident about our food, but it shows how we think of those that will eat those dishes. We want what's 
best for our guests, that's why we allow customization through the sawsawan.

In my opinion as a psychology student , the value of food in the age of globalization can be explored through various lenses. 
Psychologically, food is not only a basic physiological need but also holds cultural, social, and emotional significance. 
Globalization has led to the exchange of diverse culinary traditions, influencing individuals' preferences and identities. 
One of the best examples of this is how we Filipinos, welcomed the Korean culture of “samgyupsal”. Additionally, the accessibility 
of global cuisines may impact mental well-being, connecting people to wider cultural contexts. Culturally, the global exchange 
of culinary practices has enriched local traditions, creating a diverse and interconnected cuisine. Socially, food serves as 
a symbolic medium for communication and identity expression, fostering a sense of belonging in an increasingly interconnected 
world. However, it also raises issues related to nutrition, body image, and the psychological impact of food marketing. 
Understanding these psychological dynamics is important for addressing the complex relationship between individuals and food 
in a globalized world.

In summary, the value of food in the age of globalization is complex, including psychological effects, cultural enrichment, 
social connectivity, and many more.
